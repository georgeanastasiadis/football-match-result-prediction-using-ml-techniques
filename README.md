# Football Match Result Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

In recent years, football match predictions have become increasingly popular. With the help
of data and machine learning techniques, predictions have become more accurate. The availability
of data and the rise of social media have also made it easier for fans and sports betting
companies to access it. In this thesis, we developed machine learning methods that we trained
using publicly available data for the 4 main European football leagues to predict the outcome
of football matches. To investigate the performance of the classifiers, we considered 2 scenarios.
In the first scenario, we tried to predict the match outcomes of the last 2 seasons for the
4 leagues. In the second scenario, we considered each season separately and tried to predict
the game results of the second round of each season. To evaluate the results of the experiments,
we used the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We found
that Random Forrest outperformed the other classifiers and produced better results in most
cases.
